Kotlin Desktop App using SQL Delight to test basic operations of Adding (Insert), Deleting, Updating (Replace), Deleting All, Dropping Table.

Designed to test setting up .sq file, dependancies and co-routines. Attempted to create clean build but ... not abstracted with DI to reduce code size. 

Also expenstive in recomposition (work in progress) and keyboard numeric ?not supported in Desktop so no validity checking. 

Main aim was to demo SQL Delight functions. 

Screen shot shows Blood Pressure Data in LazyColumn. Buttons to apply SQL actions to database. Selected items appear in right Column. BP values can be entered and Item updated. Note no validity checking.
